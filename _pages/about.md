I am a third-year PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Yiqun Liu](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/). I am a member of the [THUIR (Tsinghua University Information Retrieval) Group](http://www.thuir.cn/).

I received my B.Eng. degree in Automation from Tsinghua University in June 2023, and started my PhD journey in the same year.
